      <p>
      Parents Help Parents is a platform that helps you and your family
      connect with other families that share similar values. We facilitate 
      new relationships that allow families to collaborate with childcare when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
      Parents Help Parents was founded on the need for new parents to find a support system
      with people they can trust who are also going through similar experiences.
